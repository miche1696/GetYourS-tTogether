    Typycal user interaction: 
    CASE1 ) Initiate a new habit
        USER : "I want to stick to a new habit"
        GYST : "What habit?"
        U : I want to exercise regularly

    ********FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 
    HABIT PLANNING/ORGANIZATION (needs to collaborate or connect with other specific platforms that are more vertical in the scope of the habit, in this case the training, to provide a tailored plan)
        G : What kind of training? What is your goal/drive?
        U : Lose fat and stay healty/fit
        G : Perfect, are you familiar with training? Did you train on the past?
        U : No
        G : Do you like to run/cycle or are you interest in weightlifting?
        U : Run/Cycle/Treadmill
    ********END


        G : How many times do you want to train per week?
        U : 2 times
        G : There is a moment of the day you prefer to train?
        U : No.

    ********FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 
    POSSIBILITY OF CROSS-SELLING OF SUPPORTING EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES
        G : Do you prefer to train indoor or outside?
        U : Indoor.
        G : Do you have access to a treadmill, cyclette or ellyptical? Through a gym membership?
        U : No.
        G : Do you want to subscribe a tailored gym membership to support you on this habit tracking?
        ecc...ecc...
    ********END

    ********FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 
    Gamification of the habit. Incentives, penalties. Needs integration with portfolios or other platform to make this effective. (Idea is that you could consider to penalyze the user if he/she does not train for a week, with, for example, a "lock" of 50 euro to the app that uses to make shopping)
        G : Do you wish to reinforce this habit with some achievements or penalties?
        U : Yes
        G : Do you want to setup a "salvadenaio" to reward or "punish" you when you stick or not to the habit?
        ecc...ecc...
    ********END

        G : Perfect! I will help you to Get Your S**t Together and support on this new habit!
