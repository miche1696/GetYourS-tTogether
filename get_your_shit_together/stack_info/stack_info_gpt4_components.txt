Structure:
src/
components/: Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, dialogs, etc.).
views/: Pages or screens like Login, Dashboard, HabitTracker.
state/: Redux actions, reducers, and store configuration.
utilities/: Helper functions and constants.
services/: API calls and other external services.
App.js: Main application component that includes routing.
index.js: Entry point for the React application.
Backend (Server-Side)

Docker: Containerization of the application for easy deployment.
Kubernetes: For container orchestration (if scaling is necessary).
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment, using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
Nginx: As a reverse proxy server for routing requests to the backend.
Additional Components
Technologies:
WebSockets or Socket.IO: For real-time notifications.
